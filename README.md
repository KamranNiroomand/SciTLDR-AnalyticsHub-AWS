# SciTLDR-AnalyticsHub-AWS
Components and Workflow
#
1. Data Ingestion: Utilize AWS Glue to extract, transform, and load the data into an AWS S3 bucket.
2. Data Transformation with PySpark: Use PySpark to preprocess and clean the SciTLDR data. Apply transformations such as data normalization, feature engineering, and data enrichment. Leverage PySpark's distributed processing capabilities to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. ETL Pipeline with Airflow: Create an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that orchestrates the ETL process. Define tasks within the DAG to execute PySpark scripts for data transformation and analysis. Schedule the DAG to run at regular intervals or trigger it based on specific events (e.g., new data arrival).
4. Data Quality Checks: Implement data quality checks using PySpark to ensure the integrity and completeness of the processed data. Perform checks on data types, missing values, outliers, and consistency. Raise alerts or notifications if any data quality issues are detected.
5. Error Handling and Logging: Configure Airflow to capture and log pipeline activities, errors, and execution details. Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor the pipeline's health and receive notifications in case of failures.
6. Automated Deployment on AWS: Set up an AWS infrastructure using EC2 or ECS to deploy PySpark and Airflow. Utilize AWS CloudFormation to automate the provisioning and management of the required resources.
7. Monitoring and Scaling: Implement monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail to track pipeline performance, resource utilization, and data throughput. Configure auto-scaling based on workload demands to handle variations in data volume.
8. Data Visualization and Reporting: Integrate AWS QuickSight or other visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports. Generate visualizations that provide insights into TLDRs.
9. Documentation and Collaboration: Document the pipeline architecture, workflow, and setup instructions for future reference. Collaborate using version control systems like Git and project management tools to track progress and coordinate tasks.
